# This file is used for the ideation of the slides used for this project.

## At minimum, the presentation should address the following: 
• Give a brief overview of the language.
• Who designed the language and why? 
• What does the syntax look like? 
• What programming paradigm(s) does the language implement? 
• If appropriate, is the language static or dynamic? Explain why. 
• How does this language compare to the ones we have learned (SQL, Python, F#, 
Prolog and Go)? What are the similarities and differences? 
• How does it handle memory? 
• Show a short but meaningful example (more than “Hello World!”). Live coding 
would be ideal for this, but is not required.

## Things I also want to add in order to make the presentation fun:
• What is an esoteric language?
• Starlogs to end off the presentation
• Truttle1 videos
• A fun mario speedrunning reference for all the Mario fans
• GIFS!!

## Answers to the above questions:
• What is an esoteric language?
	* Most people are used to programming languages that can efficiently solve problems related to real world industries
	or are used to produce meaningful impact within communities.
		- JavaScript, C++, and Python are the programming languages that usually come first in mind
	* Esoteric languages take a different approach - they explore the creative representation that programming languages can embark.
	They are not made to be efficient, and are usually made up as a joke. However, through these languages, we as programmers
	can have fun creating parody languages or even create languages as a form of creatistic interpretations, such as Piet, a programming language made to interpret pixels as an encoded piece of code.
		- show picture of Piet 
• Give a brief overview of the language.
	* In this presentation, we will be explore MarioLANG.
