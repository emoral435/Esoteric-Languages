# This file is used for the ideation of the slides used for this project.

## At minimum, the presentation should address the following: 
• Give a brief overview of the language. ✅
• Who designed the language and why? ✅
• What does the syntax look like? 
• What programming paradigm(s) does the language implement? 
• If appropriate, is the language static or dynamic? Explain why. 
• How does this language compare to the ones we have learned (SQL, Python, F#, 
Prolog and Go)? What are the similarities and differences? 
• How does it handle memory? 
• Show a short but meaningful example (more than “Hello World!”). Live coding 
would be ideal for this, but is not required.

## Things I also want to add in order to make the presentation fun:
• What is an esoteric language? ✅
• Starlogs to end off the presentation ✅
• Truttle1 videos ✅
• A fun mario speedrunning reference for all the Mario fans
• GIFS!!

## Answers to the above questions:
• What is an esoteric language?
	* Most people are used to programming languages that can efficiently solve problems related to real world industries
	or are used to produce meaningful impact within communities.
		- JavaScript, C++, and Python are the programming languages that usually come first in mind
	* Esoteric languages take a different approach - they explore the creative representations that programming languages can represent.
		- They are not made to be efficient, and are usually made up as a joke. 
		- show picture of Piet - They still can have creative merit, however, and perhaps we can learn from *SOME* of them

• Give a brief overview of the language.
	* In this presentation, we will be explore MarioLANG.
		- The language is composed of characters that make the source code look like a Mario level stage!
		- Mario himself represents the instruction pointer. Each character then either modifies Mario, the instruction pointer,
		or modifies a piece of memory that we can later use ourself to print to the console!
		- The language uses a one-dimensional array, or tape, to store data. In our language, item blocks affect and update our tape!
		We can move left and right, and increment our tape as we want. We can then print our tape as ASCII to get out desired console output.
		- This language does not have an official interpreter or compiler, but the author of this language does have an interpretation of what he
		himself thinks an interpreter should look like for the language. Yes, even the author of this language does not know how an interpreter would look like.

• Who designed the language and why? 
	* The creator of the language is [Wh1teWorlf](https://esolangs.org/wiki/User:Wh1teWolf). He is an anonymous developer, however, his self-bio on esolangs.orgs shows that
	he loves working on esoteric languages in his free time, specifically BrainF*ck.
	* He loves working on the aforementioned language so much that he has made several interpreters for the languages. All his variations of the language are well documented - that is, all but MarioLANG.
	* We know he is working on version 2.0, but we do not know why it was created in the first place. But... seeing as it looks cool, do we need a reason outside outside of it just being cool?

• What does the syntax look like?
	* The syntax for the language is composed of three distinct modules - *parts, items, and instructions*
