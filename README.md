   A GitHub repository dedicated towards outlining what an esoteric language is, information on the esoteric language of my choice, <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/MarioLANG">MarioLANG</a>, and examples of MarioLANG!
</p>

## Why is this so awesome? 🤔💭
* Most people who are on GitHub are programmers. And most people who are even reading this, are also programmers who are fascinated with writing solutions with code
* Esoteric languages take this a step back, and re-evaluate what a language **even is** and how it functions. These languages are love letters to the idea of programming, and can also lead to development in how other languages get made!
* The endless creativity from these languages can bring rise to the endeavors of other, more industry standard langauges to implement interesting features from esoteric langauges!

## What is the context behind this repository? 🧐
* This repository is part of my universities class, [CS 341](https://catalog.uic.edu/search/?P=CS%20341). The goal of the class is to introduce its students a wide variety of programming paradigms, languages, and language design choices.
* This repository serves as a central hub to store and share information about the esoteric langauge of choice that I decided to research and present!
